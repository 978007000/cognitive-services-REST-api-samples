# Face Rest API

These samples are quickstarts that show how to use the Face REST API.

## Prerequisites

- [An Azure Face resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/?api=face) 
- Download the images from [this repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/ComputerVision/Images/), then create an "Image" folder inside of a Visual Studio console application in your bin\debug\netcoreapp3.0 folder, then add the image to it. Or use an image of your own.
- Add your Face subscription key and endpoint to your environment variables with the suggested variable names in the sample.

## Running the samples

Run the sample in Visual Studio and see the console output.
