# Ink Recognizer REST API samples

These samples are quickstarts that show how to use the Ink Recognizer API.

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure Ink Recognizer resource](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home/searchQuery/ink%20recognizer) 
- For the sample in the Quickstart folder: create a Visual Studio C# console app and copy/paste the `recognizeInk.cs` code into your `Program.cs` file.
- Add the `example-ink-strokes.json` file to your bin\debug\netcoreapp3.0 folder.
- Add your key and endpoint from your resource to your environment variables with the variable names suggested in the sample.

## Running the samples
- If trying the UWP or WPF app (instructions in their READMEs), clone this repo and run the projects from there.<br>
  `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples.git`
- Otherwise run the Visual Studio console app for the `recognizeInk.cs` results.
